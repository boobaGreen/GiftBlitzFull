## Project Name

**GiftBlitz**

### Tagline

Secure & trustless P2P gift card exchange on IOTA — Zero disputes thanks to Mutual Trust Deposit mathematics.

---

## 📖 Overview

### The Use-Case

Every year, **$899 billion** in gift cards are sold globally (projected $2.3 trillion by 2030), yet **3-5% are never redeemed** — billions in locked value. Users who receive unwanted gift cards (Amazon, Netflix, Steam, PSN, Xbox) face a painful choice: sell them on Facebook/Telegram groups risking scams, or use centralized platforms that charge **15-20% fees** with multi-day processing.

**Target users:**
- **Sellers**: People with unused gift cards wanting cash/crypto at fair rates
- **Buyers**: Bargain hunters seeking discounted gift cards from trusted, transparent trades

**Why needed**: No existing solution offers trustless P2P exchange without high fees, intermediaries, or fraud risk.

### The Solution

GiftBlitz is a **fully decentralized dApp** on IOTA L1 that enables atomic, trustless P2P gift card trades via a **Double Trust Deposit** game theory mechanism. Both buyer and seller lock collateral into a Move smart contract escrow — making fraud **mathematically irrational**. Our **Anti-Griefing System** ensures that any dispute results in a **Mutual Reputation Reset** (both parties back to zero), making malicious behavior professionally suicidal. Gift card codes are delivered via **Proxy Re-Encryption**, ensuring zero-knowledge transfer with no central server.

**Core value proposition**: 1% fee (vs 15-20% centralized), instant settlement, zero counterparty risk, fully on-chain reputation.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Mutual Trust Deposit Escrow**: Seller stakes 100% of face value; buyer stakes 110% — game theory ensures honest behavior is the only rational choice (Nash Equilibrium).
- **Anti-Griefing Protection (MAD)**: Any dispute triggers a **Mutually Assured Destruction** protocol where both the buyer and seller's on-chain trade history is instantly reset to zero.
- **Soulbound Reputation NFT**: Non-transferable on-chain identity tracking trades, volume, and disputes — progressive buyer caps (€30→€50→€100→€200) protect the ecosystem from systemic volume attacks.
- **End-to-End Encrypted Delivery**: Gift card codes encrypted with AES-256, keys exchanged via RSA-2048 Proxy Re-Encryption — no plaintext ever on-chain
- **72h Safety Timeouts**: Automatic refunds if seller doesn't reveal key; auto-finalize if buyer doesn't respond — no funds ever locked forever
- **1% Platform Fee**: Accumulated in an on-chain Treasury — 15-20× cheaper than centralized alternatives
- **Full Audit Trail**: 5 on-chain events (BoxCreated, BoxLocked, KeyRevealed, TradeFinalized, BoxExpired) provide immutable traceability

---

## Use of IOTA Technology

### IOTA Move Smart Contracts (Core)
Two Move modules (~540 lines total) implement the entire trading protocol:
- `giftblitz.move` (448 lines): Escrow lifecycle with 6-state machine (OPEN→LOCKED→REVEALED→COMPLETED/BURNED/EXPIRED), trust deposit management, timeout claims, fee collection
- `reputation.move` (95 lines): Soulbound NFT minting, progressive trade caps, dispute penalties

### IOTA Tokenization (Primary IOTA Service)
- **GiftBox** as a **Shared Object**: Tokenized escrow accessible to seller, buyer, and system — holds encrypted code, trust deposits, payments
- **ReputationNFT** as a **Soulbound Token** (`has key` only, no `store`): Non-transferable on-chain identity with public key for PRE, trade stats, and encrypted vault for cross-browser recovery

### IOTA Blockchain Primitives
- **Capabilities pattern** (`AdminCap`): Secure admin-only treasury withdrawal
- **Clock module**: On-chain timestamps for 72h timeout enforcement
- **Move Events**: 5 event types for real-time frontend updates and immutable audit trail

> **Note**: We intentionally do NOT use IOTA Identity (DID) or IOTA Hierarchies — our Soulbound ReputationNFT serves as a custom identity proxy under the **Tokenization** service category.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### High-Level Design

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   React Frontend (SPA)  │
│   Vite + TypeScript     │
│   TailwindCSS + Framer  │
└────────┬───────┬────────┘
         │       │
    @iota/dapp-kit    @iota/iota-sdk
         │       │
┌────────▼───────▼────────┐
│   IOTA Wallet (Browser  │
│   Extension)            │
└────────┬────────────────┘
         │ Sign & Submit TXs
┌────────▼────────────────┐
│   IOTA L1 (Testnet)     │

│ │ (Soulbound NFT)     │ │
│ ├─────────────────────┤ │
│ │ Treasury (Shared)   │ │
│ └─────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Key interaction flow:**
1. Frontend connects to IOTA wallet via `@iota/dapp-kit`
2. User actions (create box, join, reveal, finalize/dispute) submit Move transactions
3. Smart contracts manage all state, funds, and encryption on-chain
4. Frontend listens to Move Events for real-time UI updates
5. No backend server needed — fully decentralized architecture
